      <h1>Nicolas Paris</h1>

      <p>I'm not a big fan of the about page, I usually do it when I'm doing
      the website, thinking that I will change it later on, but it stay for a
      year or so.</p>

      <p>So, I'm blogging mainly about programming stuff and Linux, I've
      started in 2009, back this time I only blogged in French, as I wanted to
      blog in English, I split the content between those two languages.</p>

      <p>I'm obviously French, 31 years old, you can contact me
      at <img src="images/nicomail.png">, as far as I know, I always respond to
      reader emails.</p>
