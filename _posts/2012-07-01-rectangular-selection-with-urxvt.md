Few months ago, while I was talking to some geeks at my Linux User Group, I was
surprised to see that they didn't knew about this trick, the rectangular
selection with the console URXVT.

Maybe not important, but it could be useful, especially with IRC client, such
as *weechat*. Select few lines without the nicklist or timestamps is nice when
you want do some copy/paste, even if you can switch on and off the nicklist
easily.

All you have to do for the selection is press `Alt` and select in the same
time with the left click of the mouse.
