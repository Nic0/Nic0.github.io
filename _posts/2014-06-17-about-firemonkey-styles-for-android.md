First, I have to say that I’m kind of a newbee in Delphi world… About a year at work.

I’m just starting to play at home with the Android App possibility with Delphi. First
things, I was amazed how fast it was to have a Hello world app running on my phone. I
remember how painful it was to setup the environment with Eclipse. Up and running in
less than 5 minutes, even if it was the first time I was using it.

After putting few components, I was happy with some functionalities that I came up with,
but, I thought it could looks better. I googled, found out about Stylebook, and soon I 
was looking for some *.style and *.fsf on my embacardero folder. After trying them, it 
seems that half of the dozen *.styles available wasn’t working on my Android device (
S4mini), and just 3 *.fsf specialized for Android, which I wasn’t so excited about the 
look.

So, I googled again to find some more styles for FireMonkey. I didn’t came up with 
results, I found some, not free, but I won’t buy a style for a home, for fun, side 
project. I know most of the time, for extra stuff on Delphi, you need to pay, I 
understand it, even if I have an open source background.

Did I miss something? As I said, I’m new in Delphi, I could have miss something 
interesting and obvious easily. Is there any cool FireMonkey styles somewhere, for free 
or cheap? Or should I carry on whit a kind of boring look? Any advices would be 
appreciated.
