Seems like I’m using Jekyll for a year and a half now, according to [this
post][1]. I still use it, even if I’m not bloging often. Jekyll is fun. Jekyll
is damn fast. Jekyll make me look like I’m awesome, well… maybe not. Anyway,
here some thought about the downside of using Jekyll.

I moved my blog a few times, and planning to move again for the new kimsufi
offer. And every time, I have to reinstall Jekyll, and make it work… And even
if it’s not some reinstallation, it could break with an update, already happen
to me. So when I haven’t written blog post for a few months, and I want to
spend an hour to write one. In fact, I have to spend an hour to fix Jekyll and
another one to write the post. So, if you consider installing Jekyll for a
friend or an association, you definitely should think about the maintenance of
a tech that you probably be the only one to understand.

This time, the problem was due to the UTF-8 bug. There are few issues already
open in the github bugtracker. I tried few solutions listed, but it didn’t work
for me. So I switched back the version of Ruby on my server. It’s not really a
Jekyll bug, more due to Ruby, but I don’t care whose fault is it!

Other thing, not that much important to me, but worth considering, is that
Google didn’t liked so much the new site, and I maybe lost half of the traffic
from him. I certainly done something wrong, and  I don’t specially care, but if
you do, consider this point carefully.

I still enjoy using Jekyll, when it’s working, but I sometime miss my good old
Wordpress…
