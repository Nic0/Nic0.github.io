When your native language isn't English, and when, like me, you spend time
writing around the Internet, between comments from some news sites, blog posts
and programming question-answer site, you have to deal with at least two
languages, English, and whatever language you use at home. Unfortunately, I have
trouble with grammar and spelling[^1]. I probably have done what everyone
else with bad spelling would do in this case, add to Firefox a spell checker.
It does what I want, but as I write across websites, I need to switch the
spell checker from French to English, certainly more often that I even
notice.

Switching of dictionaries is annoying, but not enough to really do something about
it. When you're switching it, you think that perhaps you should try to google about it if there is
any kind of shortcut or whatever would do the trick and save you some time, but you forget as soon as you switched
the dictionary, and your mind focus on the answer/comment you're writing. Same
thing for asking to some geek friends, quickly forgotten to ask, every time.

So I'd carry this *problem* who isn't really one, and by chance, I found the
perfect solution for what I'm asking for. It could be obvious to some persons,
but after all, I'm not switching of dictionary for that long time ago. The
answer I found is no more that [a Firefox plugin, called dictionary
switcher][1]. This plugin recognize automatically the language you are taping of, and adapt the
dictionary in function of it, few more options on it to do more precisely what you want. With a
name link that, I could find it earlier, but the thing is I didn't toke time to
look for.

Short blog post, for a quick trick, maybe it could be useful to someone else.
