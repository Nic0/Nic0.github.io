title: Small project's life depends on his owner
category: programming
---
Last year, I wrote a small program, a twitter's client with a ncurses
interface, called [Tyrs][1]. It's a small project, but used by some persons and
have some activities with bugs reports and pull requests. The problem is I'm
getting bored of the project, moved on to other personal stuffs and learning,
and time isn't extensible.  I learned from it and really enjoyed the time
spend.

I don't believe in Christmas, I know if I don't really maintain the program
anymore, it will be abandoned, some dependencies releases would mess up the
program or I don't know. This is probably a very usual problem, the owner stops
maintain the program for some reason, and nobody will carry on the project.

When I'm saying "small project", I haven't defined what a small project is, but
in fact, I'm sure the problem occur for much more projects that I would think,
even some quite interesting and known project.

I would love some kind of website where I could subscribe my project, to find a
new owner for the project. I don't know if a website like that exists, or even
if people would be interested for, but I know that it's always interesting to
read through other code, it would be a good and useful way to progress.

A short write-up, because there isn't so much to say about it. Of course, I
have no regret for endless night spend on this project, I just hope it won't
end like thousands of other projects, unmaintained.
